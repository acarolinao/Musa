This repository contains the scripts used in chapters 2 and 3 of the thesis: Species-wide diversity of Musa spp. NLR genes and their distinct response to Fusarium TR4 infection submited the 30th of September of 2025

1. Musa diversity genotypic characterization
   A diversity panel of 201 accesions was genotyped with a SNP-based variant calling used for principal component anaylsis (pca), phylogeny and population      structure. The reference genome of Musa acuminata spp malaccensis (DH-Pahang) v4 published in 2021 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02559-3)       was used to align the reads of the accesions in the panel for the variant calling.
