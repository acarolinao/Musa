# 1. Musa diversity genotypic characterization  

A diversity panel of 201 accesions was genotyped with a SNP-based variant calling used for principal component anaylsis (pca), phylogeny and population structure. The reference genome of Musa acuminata spp malaccensis (DH-Pahang) v4 published in 2021 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02559-3) was used to align the reads of the accesions in the panel for the variant calling.
